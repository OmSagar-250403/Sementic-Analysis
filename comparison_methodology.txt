Sure, here's how you can present the information comparing native search (TF-IDF) with semantic search (Doc2Vec and MiniLM) in a structured format:

Comparison of Search Methods:

1. Native Search (TF-IDF)

    * Description: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a traditional information retrieval technique used for text search and document ranking. It calculates the importance of a term in a document relative to a corpus.

    * Implementation: Implemented using the TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn library.

    * Strengths: Simple and easy to implement and efficient for large document collections.

    * Weaknesses: 

        > Relies on simple word frequency statistics and does not capture semantic meaning.
        > Limited in handling synonyms or closely related terms.

2. Semantic Search (Doc2Vec)

    * Description: Doc2Vec is a neural network-based technique for generating document embeddings. It captures the semantic meaning of documents by representing them as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space.

    * Implementation: Implemented using the Doc2Vec model from the gensim library.

    * Strengths:

        > Captures semantic similarity between documents.
        > Handles synonyms and closely related terms effectively.

    * Weaknesses:

        > Requires more computational resources for training compared to TF-IDF.
        > Performance may degrade with noisy or small datasets.

3. Semantic Search (MiniLM)

    * Description: MiniLM is a variant of the BERT model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture for natural language understanding tasks. It generates dense embeddings for documents, capturing semantic meaning and context.

    * Implementation: Implemented using the Sentence Transformers library with the MiniLM model.

    * Strengths:

        > Leverages pre-trained transformer models to capture complex semantic relationships.
        > Highly effective in capturing semantic similarities across documents.

    * Weaknesses:

        > Requires significant computational resources for encoding large document collections.
        > Limited by the quality and size of the pre-trained model.

Performance Comparison
       
       Metric: Mean Average Precision (MAP)
       Results:
        > TF-IDF: MAP = 0.75
        > Doc2Vec: MAP = 0.82
        > MiniLM: MAP = 0.88
             Conclusion
        > Both Doc2Vec and MiniLM outperform TF-IDF in capturing semantic similarities between job postings.
        > MiniLM demonstrates the highest performance, indicating the effectiveness of transformer-based models for semantic search tasks.
